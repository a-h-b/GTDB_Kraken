# GTDB_Kraken
Kraken(2) database based on the GTDB project

This page will contain links, notes and scripts for kraken databases we produced based on the GTDB database (http://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/). The kraken database contains 1 genome per taxon recognized in the GTDB database. Given that the the taxonomy of the GTDB database is based on genomic data, we expect this database to result in better performance for taxonomy-based classifier algorithms.    

## Version 1
Notes:
- Based on GTDB Release 03-RS86 (19th August 2018)
- Not the complete GTDB database, taxa without a genus designation have been omitted (10,994 out of 11042 taxa in this version)
- Reference sequences have been selected ad hoc, without regard for the quality of the sequence. This will be dealt with in future versions  

### Kraken2 db (65 Gb, tarball 48 Gb):

## Building from source

To download all fasta files and compile from source, you can run the provided script with the input file from the GTDB project.  Next, use the `--add-to-library` and `--build` functions in Kraken to format the database.  Example commands are below.

### Requirements

* Edirect - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/
* Perl
  * BioPerl - https://bioperl.org/INSTALL.html
* Kraken or Kraken2

### Example commands for building from source

    # Creates the directory library/gtdb and adds fasta files.
    # Also creates a taxonomy folder, compatible with Kraken.
    perl scripts/gtdbToTaxonomy.pl --infile data/gtdb.2018-12-10.tsv
    # Format the database.
    db=GTDB_Kraken
    for i in library/gtdb/*.fna; do 
      kraken-build --add-to-library $i --db $db
    done
    kraken-build --build --db $db --threads 8

### Cleanup (optional)

You can optionally remove all intermediate fasta files and also run the clean utility in Kraken.

    rm -rvf library/gtdb
    kraken-build --clean $db
