# GTDB_Kraken
Kraken(2) database based on the GTDB project

This page will contain links, notes and scripts for kraken databases me and Lee Katz produced based on the GTDB database (http://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/). The kraken database contains 1 genome per taxon recognized in the GTDB database. Given that the the taxonomy of the GTDB database is based on genomic data, we expect this database to result in better performance for taxonomy-based classifier algorithms.    

## Version 1
Notes:
- Based on GTDB Release 03-RS86 (19th August 2018)
- Not the complete GTDB database, taxa without a genus designation have been omitted (10,994 out of 11042 taxa in this version)
- Reference sequences have been selected ad hoc, without regard for the quality of the sequence. This will be dealt with in future versions
